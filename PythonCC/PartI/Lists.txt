What Is a list?
A list is a collection of items in a particular order.
You can make a list that includes the letters of the alphabet, digits from 0–9, or names of peoples.
You can put anything you want into a list, and the items in your list don’t have to be
related in any particular way.
In Python, square brackets ([]) indicate a list, and individual elements in the list
are separated by commas.
Here’s a simple example of a list that contains a few kinds of bicycles:

bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles)

Accessing Elements in a List :
Lists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by
knowing the index of the item desired.
To access an ele- ment in a list, write the name of the list followed
by the index of the item enclosed in square brackets.

print(bicycles[0])

Index Positions Start at 0, Not 1
Python considers the first item in a list to be at position 0, not position 1.
If you’re receiving unexpected results, determine whether you are making a simple off-by-one error.
you can get any element you want from a list utilizing index : n - 1, Where n is the number of elements
in the list.

You can figure out the number of elements in a list using the built-in-function <len()>

print(len(bicycles))

You can access the last element in a list. By asking for the item at index -1

print(bicycles[-1])

Changing, adding, and removing elements:
Most lists you create will be dynamic, meaning you’ll build a list and
then add and remove, change elements from it.

    Modifying Elements in a List:
        To change an element, use the name of the list followed by the index of the element
        you want to change, and then provide the new value you want that item to have.

    motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
    print(motorcycles)
    vmotorcycles[0] = 'ducati'
    print(motorcycles)

    Adding Elements to a List:
        The simplest way to add a new element to a list is to append the item to the list.
        and then the element is added to the end of the list.

    motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
    print(motorcycles)
    motorcycles.append('ducati')
    print(motorcycles)

    Inserting Elements into a List:
        You can add a new element at any position in your list by using the insert() method.
        You do this by specifying the index of the new element and the value of the new item.
    
    motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
    motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati')
    print(motorcycles)

    Removing Elements from a List:
        removing an Item Using the del Statement:
            If you already know the position of the item you want to remove better option is to use
            the <del> Statement.
        
        motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
        print(motorcycles)
        del motorcycles[0]
        print(motorcycles)

        removing an Item Using the pop() Method :
            The pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work with that item
            after removing it.

        motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
        print(motorcycles)
        popped_motorcycle = motorcycles.pop()
        print(motorcycles)
        print(popped_motorcycle)

            You can actually use pop() to remove an item in a list at any position
            by including the index of the item you want to remove in parentheses.

        motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
        first_owned = motorcycles.pop(0)
        print('The first motorcycle I owned was a ' + first_owned.title() + '.')

        removing an Item by Value :
            Sometimes you won’t know the position of the value you want to remove from a list.
            If you only know the value of the item you want to remove, you can use the remove() method.
        
        motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']
        print(motorcycles)
        motorcycles.remove('ducati')
        print(motorcycles)

If you’re unsure whether to use the del statement or the pop() method, here’s a simple way to decide:
->When you want to delete an item from a list and not use that item in any way, use the del statement.
->If you want to use an item as you remove it, use the pop() method.
